# Koha CSS files

Sample CSS files suitable for targeting with the following Koha system preferences:

* NoticeCSS
* SlipCSS

Each system preference has its own directory, with file names describing the purpose of the CSS file, e.g.

    NoticeCSS/envelope_window.css

The repository is meant to be forked so that you can make and save local edits.

Once you've forked the repository, go to the `Settings` link at the top of the page of your fork. Scroll down to the section called `GitHub Pages` and set Source to `master branch`.

The link to your CSS file will be in

    https://<<YOUR USER NAME>>.github.io/kohacss/<<PATH TO CSS FILE>>

e.g.

    https://bywatersolutions.github.io/kohacss/NoticeCSS/envelope_window.css

This is the link that you will use in the system preference.
